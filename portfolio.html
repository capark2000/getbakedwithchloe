            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>I am a lot of things. To start, I am a student at the Univerisity of Michigan. That's actually why I am making this website in the first place. 
                It's all part of a project for my SI 339 class: Web Design and Accessibility. When trying to think of what to make for my portfolio project, I 
                wanted to make sure the website would be something I was interested in creating, and also had the possibility of using again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Baking was the easy answer to all of this. I have loved to bake when I was in 6th grade, and it has taken over my life since. Every project since then
                that I have been given even the slightest bit of personal creativity, I have tied back to baking. My eigth grade capstone project I made candy and blogged about it. 
                Senior year, I dropped 3 classes for a senior project and baked my way through Julia Child's cookbooks. When applying both to the Univesity of Michigan and
                 the University's School of Information, my personal essays correlated my love for baking to my analytic mindset (baking is an exact science,
                 even if you may not know it). The list goes on and on. 
            </p>
            <p>On this website, I'll show you a little more about myself: my baking skills, my attempts at cooking healthy while on a time crunch in college, and my life overall. I hope you enjoy!</p>

                    <li>I was born in Canada</li>
                    <li>I moved to Kansas when I was 2, and Atlanta when I was 5</li>
                    <li>I started baking in 6th grade as a way to make some sweet treats to have around the house</li>
                    <li>In high school, I took my baking skills up a notch, 
                        and would sell customized baked goods to people in my community</li>
                    <li>When I came to UMich, I stopped baking as much because I lived in and dorm and
                        a sorority house for two years</li>
                    <li>Now that I live in a house of my own, I am excited to get back into my passion!</li>
