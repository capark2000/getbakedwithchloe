        <ul>
            <li>Whisk 1 cup of warmed MILK, 1 tbsp dry active YEAST, and 1/3 cup of granulated SUGAR in a bowl and let sit, covered for around 4 minutes or until the mixture is foamy</li>
            <li>Whisk in 2 large EGGS, 6 tbsp of melted BUTTER, 1 tsp VANILLA extract, 1/2 a cup of FLOUR, and a dash of NUTMEG and SALT</li>
            <li>Add 3 1/2 cups of FLOUR and mix until the dough comes together but is still sticky (add more for consistency if needed)</li>
            <li>Cover the dough and let it rise until doubled in size (around 1.5 to 2 hours)</li>
            <li>Roll out and cut the dough into desired shape</li>
            <li>Heat oil of your choosing to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (HINT** If you do not have a thermometer, you can tell the oil is ready when a wooden stick or spoon causes a slight boil when placed in the oil)</li>
            <li>Fry the donuts using your judgement for cooking time on each side (it shouldn't be long)</li>
            <li>Decorate with whatever toppings you would like (I prefer cinnamon sugar) and ENJOY</li>
        </ul>
